\subsection*{Description}

The main result of the second paper concerns a mathematical concept called a duality theory. A duality is a way to view a collection of objects ``through a mirror'' and study their reflections instead of their direct features. Studying a concept in its mirror image, and then dualizing, should be equivalent to studying the concept directly. The concept and its mirror fit together like two hequal halves of a whole, which is what we have attempted to convey with the drawing.
