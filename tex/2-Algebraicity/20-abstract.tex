    Using Patchkoria--Pstr{\k a}gowski's version of Franke's algebraicity theorem, we prove that the category of $K_p(n)$-local spectra is exotically equivalent to the category of derived $I_n$-complete periodic comodules over the Adams Hopf algebroid $(E_*, E_*E)$ for large primes. This gives a finite prime result analogous to the asymptotic algebraicity for $\SpK$ of Barthel--Schlank--Stapleton.
