    We study the interplay between localizing subcategories in a stable $\infty$-category $\C$ with $t$-structure $(\C\geqz, \C\leqz)$, the prestable $\infty$-category $\C\geqz$ and the abelian category $\C^\heart$. We prove that weak localizing subcategories of $\C^\heart$ are in bijection with the localizing subcategories of $\C$ where object-containment can be checked on the heart. This generalizes similar known correspondences for noetherian rings and bounded $t$-structures. We also prove that this restricts to a bijection between localizing subcategories of $\C^\heart$, and localizing subcategories of $\C$ that are kernels of $t$-exact functors --- lifting Lurie's correspondence between localizing subcategories in $\C\geqz$ and $\C^\heart$ to the stable category $\C$.
