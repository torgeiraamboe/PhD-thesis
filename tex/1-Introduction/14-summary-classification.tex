In paper 1 we studied a specific interaction between a localizing subcategory of an abelian category, and a localizing subcategory of a stable $\infty$-category. More precicely, we studied how the adapted homology theory $E_* \: \Spn \to \ComodE$ could be restricted to an adapted homology theory $E_* \: \Mn \to \Comodt$, where $\Mn$ is a localizing subcategory of $\Spn$, while $\Comodt$ is a localizing subcategory of $\ComodE$. 

These former homology theory has an associated category of synthetic spectra, $\SynE$, which is a presentable stable $\infty$-category with a right complete $t$-structure compatible with filtered colimits. The heart of this category is precicely $\ComodE$. 

Motivated by this setup the goal of the paper \cite{aambo_2024_localizing} is to understand how to lift localizing subcategories of an abelian category $\A$ through a $t$-structure on a stable $\infty$-category $\C$, with a $t$-structure with heart $\C^\heart \simeq \A$. Using an analogous prestable classification due to Lurie in \citeme, we proved the following classification result. 

\begin{theorem}
    If $\C$ is a presentable stable $\infty$-category, with a right complete $t$-structure $(\C\geqz, \C\leqz)$, compatible with filtered colimits, then there are one-to-one correspondences 
    \[\piexact \simeq \separating \simeq \ablocalizing.\]
\end{theorem}
