Positselski's comodule-contramodule correspondence, see \citeme,  gives an adjunction between comodules and contramodules over coalgebras in certain categories --- like vector spaces over a field. In many nice cases this adjunction is actually an equivalence, for example when the coalgebra $K$ is co-separable. 

We had two central goals for the second paper, \cite{aambo_2024_positselski}: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Set up a Positselski duality for cocommutative coalgebras in symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories. 
    \item Prove that for compactly generated symmetric monoidal stable $\infty$-categories, Positselski duality recovers local duality, in the sense of \citeme. 
\end{enumerate}

The latter would give new categorical descriptions of categories of interest, like $\SpKpn$ and $\Der(R)^\wedge_p$, as certain categories of contramodules. Admittedly, these new descriptions does not offer any great new insight into the categories, but having a description of ``algebraic nature'' can often be enlightening in itself, as it could allow us to pull in ideas from other areas of mathematics. 

\begin{theorem}
    If $\C$ is a presentably symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category, and $C\in \C$ a cocummutative coidempotent coalgebra, then there is an equivalence 
    \[\Comod_C(\C)\simeq \Contra_C(\C)\]
    of symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}
    In the case $\C= \Spn$ and $C = \Mn\S$, we get symmetric monoidal equivalences 
    \[\Comod_{\Mn\S}(\Spn) \simeq \Mn \text{ and } \Contra_{\Mn\S}(\Spn)\simeq \SpKpn.\]
\end{example}
