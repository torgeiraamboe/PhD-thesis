\subsection{Paper 1}

In \cite{patchkoria-pstragowski_2021} the authors prove, among other things, an algebraicity result for chromatic homotopy theory, based on earlier work by Franke in \cite{franke_96} and Pstr\a{}gowski in \cite{pstragowski_2021}. More precisely they prove that there is an equivalence of homotopy $k$-categories 
\[h_k \Spn \simeq h_k \Dper(\ComodE)\]
for all primes $p$ and chromatic heights $n$ such that $k = 2p-2-n^2-n > 0$. The main goal of the first paper of this thesis, \cite{aambo_2024_algebraicity}, is to prove a similar result for the category $\SpKpn$. 

\begin{theorem}
    If $p$ is a prime number, and $n$ a non-negative integer such that $k = 2p-2-n^2-n > 0$, then there is an equivalence of homotopy $k$-categories 
    \[h_k \SpKpn \simeq \Dper(\ComodE)^\wedge_{I_n},\]
    where $I_n \subseteq \pi_* E_n$ is the height $n$ Landweber ideal. 
\end{theorem}
