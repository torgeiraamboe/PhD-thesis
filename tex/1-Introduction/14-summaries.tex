\subsection{Paper I}

In \cite{patchkoria-pstragowski_2021} the authors prove, among other things, an algebraicity result for chromatic homotopy theory, based on earlier work by Franke in \cite{franke_96} and Pstr\a{}gowski in \cite{pstragowski_2021}. More precisely they prove that there is an equivalence of homotopy $k$-categories 
\[h_k \Sp\np \simeq h_k \Fr\np\]
for all primes $p$ and chromatic heights $n$ such that $k = 2p-2-n^2-n > 0$. Here the category $\Fr\np$ denotes the Franke category, which is the derived category of periodic comodules over the Hopf algrbroid $E_*E$ associated to height $n$ Morava $E$-theory. Alternatively, this is the derived category of twisted sheaves on the open substack $\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{fg}}^{\leq n}$ of the moduli stack of formal groups, which is more in line with the original formulation used by Franke in \cite{franke_96}. 

The main goal of the first paper of this thesis, \cite{aambo_2024_algebraicity}, is to prove a similar result for the category $\SpKpn$. 

\begin{theorem}
    \label{ch0:summary1:thm:main}
    If $p$ is a prime number, and $n$ a non-negative integer such that $k = 2p-2-n^2-n > 0$, then there is an equivalence of homotopy $k$-categories 
    \[h_k \SpKpn \simeq h_k\Fr\np^{I_n-comp},\]
    where $I_n \subseteq \pi_* E_n$ is the height $n$ Landweber ideal. 
\end{theorem}

It is a well known idea that $K(n)$-localization acts on spectra similar til how $I_n$-completion acts on the derived category. For example, it was shown in \citeme that an $E_n$-module $M$ is $K(n)$-local if and only if its homotopy groups $\pi_* M$ are $I_n$-complete. The above theorem should then be thought of as a more global reason for why $K(n)$-localization and $I_n$-completion are related. 

An analogous result was also proven by Barthel--Schlank--Stapleton in \cite{barthel-schlank-stapleton_2021}, where the authors prove that taking the ultraproduct over all primes gives an equivalence of symmetric monoidal stable $\infty$-categories 
\[\prod \SpKpn \simeq \prod \Fr\np^{I_n-comp}.\]
Their result can be thought of as an ``asymptotic'' version of \cref{ch0:summary1:thm:main}. To prove this equivalence the authors pass to the dual category of monochromatic spectra, $\M\np$, which has some properties in connection with the derived categories that are easier to work with. We also take the same route, but combine it with the approach of Patchkoria--Pstr\a{}gowsi in \cite{patchkoria-pstragowski_2021}. 

Our first main result is that the conservative adapted homology theory $\pi_* \: \ModE \to \modE$ restricts to a conservative adapted homology theory $\pi_* \: \Modt\to \modt$, and that the Grothendieck abelian category $\modt$ satisfies similar cohomological finiteness properties as $\modE$. We then use this to prove the same statement for the more complicated category of monochromatic spectra, $\M\np$. 

\begin{theorem}
    The conservative adapted homology theory $E_*\: \Sp\np\to \ComodE$ restricts to a conservative adapted homology theory $E_*\: \M\np\to \Comodt$. Furthermore, the category $\Comodt$ has cohomological dimension $n^2+n$ whenever $p-1$ does not divide $n$. 
\end{theorem}

Using the general machinery set up in \cite{patchkoria-pstragowski_2021}, this immediately implies that there is an equivalence of homotopy $k$-categories
\[h_k \M\np \simeq h_k\Fr\np^{I_n-tors}\]
whenever $k= 2p-2-n^2-2>0$. Using a sequence of local duality arguments, as recalled in \cref{ch0:ssec:local-duality}, together with some results about interactions with Barr--Beck monadicity --- which can be found in \cref{ch1:app:barr-beck} --- this implies \cref{ch0:summary1:thm:main}. 




\subsection{Paper II}

Positselski's comodule-contramodule correspondence, see \citeme,  gives an adjunction between comodules and contramodules over coalgebras in certain categories --- like vector spaces over a field. In many nice cases this adjunction is actually an equivalence, for example when the coalgebra $K$ is co-separable. 

We had two central goals for the second paper, \cite{aambo_2024_positselski}: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Set up a Positselski duality for cocommutative coalgebras in symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories. 
    \item Prove that for compactly generated symmetric monoidal stable $\infty$-categories, Positselski duality recovers local duality, in the sense of \citeme. 
\end{enumerate}

The latter would give new categorical descriptions of categories of interest, like $\SpKpn$ and $\Der(R)^\wedge_p$, as certain categories of contramodules. Admittedly, these new descriptions does not offer any great new insight into the categories, but having a description of ``algebraic nature'' can often be enlightening in itself, as it could allow us to pull in ideas from other areas of mathematics. 

\begin{theorem}
    If $\C$ is a presentably symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category, and $C\in \C$ a cocummutative coidempotent coalgebra, then there is an equivalence 
    \[\Comod_C(\C)\simeq \Contra_C(\C)\]
    of symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}
    In the case $\C= \Spn$ and $C = \Mn\S$, we get symmetric monoidal equivalences 
    \[\Comod_{\Mn\S}(\Spn) \simeq \Mn \text{ and } \Contra_{\Mn\S}(\Spn)\simeq \SpKpn.\]
\end{example}




\subsection{Paper III}

In paper 1 we studied a specific interaction between a localizing subcategory of an abelian category, and a localizing subcategory of a stable $\infty$-category. More precicely, we studied how the adapted homology theory $E_* \: \Spn \to \ComodE$ could be restricted to an adapted homology theory $E_* \: \Mn \to \Comodt$, where $\Mn$ is a localizing subcategory of $\Spn$, while $\Comodt$ is a localizing subcategory of $\ComodE$. 

These former homology theory has an associated category of synthetic spectra, $\SynE$, which is a presentable stable $\infty$-category with a right complete $t$-structure compatible with filtered colimits. The heart of this category is precicely $\ComodE$. 

Motivated by this setup the goal of the paper \cite{aambo_2024_localizing} is to understand how to lift localizing subcategories of an abelian category $\A$ through a $t$-structure on a stable $\infty$-category $\C$, with a $t$-structure with heart $\C^\heart \simeq \A$. Using an analogous prestable classification due to Lurie in \citeme, we proved the following classification result. 

\begin{theorem}
    If $\C$ is a presentable stable $\infty$-category, with a right complete $t$-structure $(\C\geqz, \C\leqz)$, compatible with filtered colimits, then there are one-to-one correspondences 
    \[\piexact \simeq \separating \simeq \ablocalizing.\]
\end{theorem}
