\section{Addendum: Modules over pro-algebras}

We ended the last section by wishing for a way to construct a well behaved category of contramodules over the $K(n)$-local and $T(n)$-local spheres, $\S_\Kn$ and $\S_\Tn$. The current section is not a part of the paper \cite{aambo_2024_positselski}, but we wanted to include some progress on the above question.
