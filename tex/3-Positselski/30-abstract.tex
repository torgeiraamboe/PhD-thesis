    We introduce the notion of a contramodule over a cocommutative coalgebra in a presentably symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category $\C$. Based on this we prove that local duality, in the sense of Hovey--Palmieri--Strickland and Dwyer--Greenlees, is equivalent to Positselski's comodule-contramodule correspondence for coidempotent cocommutative coalgebras in compactly generated symmetric monoidal stable $\infty$-cateogories.
